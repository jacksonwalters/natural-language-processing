PROBLEM: use dataset of twitter comments and write notebook in Python to perform topic modeling

SOLUTION 1:

CLUSTERING: use gensim doc2vec to embed comments, and k-means clustering to group.

LABELING:

option 1: given list of keywords L, create bigrams and embed using doc2vec. find bigram closest to centroid
option 2: take top two most frequent words in each cluster to get bigrams, or use TF-IDF
option 3: use word embeddings to compute minimum distance from keyword to cluster vocabulary

TO-DO:

- try to separate clusters by tuning doc2vec model, e.g. use higher embedding dimension
- measure distances between centroids, see if they are close
- visualize clusters with PCA or t-SNE

---

SOLUTION 2:

Use NMF or LDA. Use TF-IDF vectorizer instead of doc2vec for embedding.
