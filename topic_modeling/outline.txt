use dataset of comments and write notebook in Python to perform topic modeling using doc2vec and k-means clustering

option 1: given list of keywords L, create bigrams and embed using doc2vec. find bigram closest to centroid
option 2: take top two most frequent words in each cluster to get bigrams, or use TF-IDF
option 3: use word embeddings to compute minimum distance from keyword to cluster vocabulary

---

TO-DO:

- try to separate clusters by tuning doc2vec model, e.g. use higher embedding dimension
- measure distances between centroids, see if they are close
- visualize clusters with PCA or t-SNE

- perform LDA (latent Dirichlet allocation) analysis
