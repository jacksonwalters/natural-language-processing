PROBLEM: use dataset of twitter comments and write notebook in Python to perform topic modeling

SOLUTION 1:

CLUSTERING: use gensim doc2vec to embed comments, and k-means clustering to group.

LABELING: Use TF-IDF on documents in cluster and take words with top scores.

NOTES:

Clusters are fairly well separated upon inspection with PCA. The distances make sense. 

The best option for labeling seems to be using TF-IDF to get the top two words with the best score. 

One can really look at the top ten words or so and get a pretty clear idea of what the topic is. With a little filtering for "words" like "http", it would give a clear idea of what the cluster is about.

SOLUTION 2: 

Use NMF or LDA. Use TF-IDF vectorizer. 

NOTES: This works pretty well.
