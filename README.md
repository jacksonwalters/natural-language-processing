ML on M1: https://caffeinedev.medium.com/how-to-install-tensorflow-on-m1-mac-8e9b91d93706

For Keras/TensorFlow on an Apple M1, I'm using conda miniforge with TensorFlow installed in a virtual environment. Much of the NLP uses NLTK rather than spaCy, with separately downloaded Glove word embeddings.


1. Binary *sentence classification* via CNN/RNN.
2. *Text summarization* via Glove embeddings, cosine similarity matrix, and pagerank.
3. *Sentiment analysis* via logistic regression.
4. *Keyword extraction* via TF-IDF.
5. *Hate speech detection* using SGDClassifier.
6. Next word prediction using Keras/TF.
